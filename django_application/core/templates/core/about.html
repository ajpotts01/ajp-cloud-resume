  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
  <p>I am a cloud technologist based in Sydney, Australia.</p>
  <p>I was a software developer for 10+ years, but always did a bit of everything:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Desktop, mobile and web dev in numerous frameworks and languages - but most at-home with C# and Python</li>
    <li>"Old-school" business intelligence with the SQL Server Stack</li>
    <li>Sometimes I even put my infrastructure and networking hat on</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I took a hard right turn into "modern" data engineering a little while ago, and that is my "focus". In reality, I'm up for any technical challenge - especially when it's something my teams are struggling with and they need someone to figure new things out quickly.</p>
  <p>I built this site for the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev">Cloud Resume Challenge</a> as a way to learn some new skills and get back in touch with old ones.</p>
