Thank you for visiting my website.

I am a cloud technologist based in Sydney, Australia.

I was a software developer for 10+ years, but always did a bit of everything:

- Desktop, mobile and web dev in numerous frameworks and languages - but most at-home with C# and Python
- "Old-school" business intelligence with the SQL Server Stack
- Sometimes I even put my infrastructure and networking hat on.

I took a hard right turn into "modern" data engineering a little while ago, and that is my "focus". In reality, I'm up for any technical challenge - especially when it's something my teams are struggling with and they need someone to figure new things out quickly.

I built this site for the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev) as a way to learn some new skills and get back in touch with old ones.
