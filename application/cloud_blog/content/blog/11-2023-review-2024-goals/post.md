This is just a short post covering some highlights of my learning in 2023 and what I hope to study in 2024.

#### Events
- DataEngBytes was a great day of data and ML talks. My favourite was probably [Ben Boyter's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovXPxdJJSU8) on the possibilities of data processing with [Go](https://go.dev). Utah Go community regular Miriah Peterson is another figure to follow in this space. She's actually doing a [presentation](https://www.linkedin.com/events/end2enddataanalyticsfornon-prof7148080306338578432/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_content%3BYB8KerkfQQqDiuN4pLCPYA%3D%3D) tomorrow on end-to-end analytics with the language.

- On the topic of Go, the Golang Syd meetup has had killer talks in both events I attended in 2023:
  - [Evergen](https://evergen.energy/) using Go in their renewable energy platform

  - [Nearmap](https://www.nearmap.com/au/en?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic) using Go in their highly advanced computer vision/GIS solutions

  - Broderick Westrope's talk on [terminal user interfaces and charm.sh](https://github.com/Broderick-Westrope/golang-syd-meetup-nov2023) really opened me up to some project ideas with Go that I will take a crack at this year.

#### Books
I read a LOT of books this year, so here are a few favourites:
- [Network Science with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/network-science-with-python/9781801073691). I really think this is an untapped resource, especially in the security domain where I currently work. David Knickerbocker has put together some great exercises and has an easily digestible writing style.

- [Data Engineering with AWS - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/data-engineering-with-aws-second-edition/9781804614426). What a whopper. This is easily one of the most comprehensive data engineering books I've read. I wish I had read the original edition in 2021. Despite the AWS tag, this really goes into a lot of detail about data modelling approaches, small-to-medium data processing with serverless frameworks, and - gasp - tips for having meetings with stakeholders!

- [Test Driven Development with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Python-Selenium-JavaScript-ebook/dp/B074HXXXLS). This is an old one, but I still highly recommend. The second edition might have a few things in it that modern developers don't recommend anymore, and its examples are in Django 1.x, but I have still found it very useful. It also punches well above its weight in examples - going into deploying apps on VMs and using nginx to serve them, which are skills still very relevant today. Note: A free version is available on the [author's website](https://obeythetestinggoat.com) and a 3rd edition is currently being phased in on this version with Django 4.x!

- [The Cloud Resume Challenge Guidebook](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/). I got the GCP version, and it inspired the creation of this website.

The first two books from Packt are on sale in digital form for $10 right now - I highly recommend them.

#### Courses
I've gone through [MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) this year to get further up to date with my software development skills:

- [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) is entirely focused on backend development, with courses in Python, Javascript and Go. There are also courses on modern CI/CD and a new one on Kubernetes. A lot of the material is introductory for people that don't have a CS background, but I learned a ton from the Go courses and some of the things I built after following them have featured on this blog. Highly recommended for beginners or people who want to learn Go in a very practical way.

- [testdriven.io](https://testdriven.io). I have done their courses on [TDD with Django Rest Framework and Docker](https://testdriven.io/courses/tdd-django/) and [Full-stack Django with HTMX, Alpine and Tailwind](https://testdriven.io/courses/django-htmx/). Both are fantastic and cheap, although it is all written material, no videos. I don't think this matters. I still have a few to go through as I picked up a holiday bundle.

Also a special shout-out to [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com). I covered the applied skills experiment in a [previous blog post]({{< ref "/blog/09-ms-applied-skills-power-automate/post" >}}) and will continue with these this year.

#### What am I doing in 2024?

Here are my learning goals in 2024:

- Attend, at the very least, one developer conference. I missed [GopherCon](https://gophercon.com.au) last year to scheduling issues and have attended multiple data engineering conferences before, so want to change it up. NDC Sydney is **very** expensive to the point where I'm too guilty to ask my employer to subsidise it, so I'll likely target [ServerlessDays ANZ](https://anz.serverlessdays.io/). [Peter Hanssens](https://www.peterhanssens.com.au/) is a great conference organiser and gives his all for multiple engineering communities, so it will be good to continue supporting him and his team of organisers

- Achieve my [Terraform certification](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate). I believe in the technology - despite the HashiCorp drama - and wanted to get his done over the holidays but just didn't have the time

- Achieve my [Microsoft Azure Developer certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-developer/). I have a 50% off voucher from MS and am annoyed that I haven't kept my .NET skills up to date at all so this seems to be a way to do it and study the MS approach to serverless computing

- Build more projects: 

  - With [HTMX](https://htmx.org). I don't know if this will ever become a skill needed for my line of work, but I don't care. I love it and will make future blog posts on it soon

  - With [Django](https://djangoproject.com). The first version of this site was a Django site and even though it didn't survive, I want to keep building with it

  - With [Angular](https://angular.io). It was my first SPA framework and as you can probably tell, I'm a big fan of opinionated frameworks. I think they help generalists like me just get work done

  - With [ASP.NET](https://asp.net). While I love Django, it's not hugely popular in Australia and I'd like to get back to my C# roots

  - With [Go](https://go.dev). I have a terminal UI project in mind for later this year and I still want to get better at using Go to build APIs and DevOps tooling

  - With [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric). Community legend [Mimoune Djouallah](https://datamonkeysite.com/about/) was the first person to make me aware of the power of [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) and we've talked about random data engineering stuff for years. He's now over at Microsoft as a program manager for Fabric and he's convinced me to take a stab at it.

- Keep reading!

This seems like a lot, and I'm sure it will change over time as my priorities shift and new shiny rabbits appear. But it's a start, and hitting one or two of these really well will still make me happy by the end of the year.

Thanks for reading, and happy new year.
